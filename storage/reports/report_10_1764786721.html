Probability &amp; StatisticsBAS331 – BAS332Assignment 1Instructors: Dr. Emad Yacoub                    Dr. Ashraf Fahim                        Dr. Abd El Ghany Bedair TA: Chapter 1Sampling Distribution.1] The heights of North American women are normally distributed with a mean of 64 inches and a standard deviation of 2 inches.(a) What is the probability that a randomly selected woman is taller than 66 inches? (b) A random sample of four women is selected. What is the probability that the sample mean height is greater than 66 inches?(c) What is the probability that the mean height of a random sample of 100 women is greater than 66 inches?2] A normal population has a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 12. You select a random sample  
    of 9. Compute the probability the sample mean is:      (a) Greater than 63.                (b) Less than 56.                  (c) Between 56 and 63.3] A normal population has a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 5. You select a sample of 40. Compute the probability the sample mean is:   (a) Less than 74.        (b) Between 74 and 76.         (c) Between 76 and 77.       (d) Greater than 77.4] In a certain section of Southern California, the distribution of monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment has a mean of $2,200 and a standard deviation of $250. The distribution of the monthly rent follows the normal distribution. What is the probability of selecting a sample of 50 one-bedroom apartments and finding the mean to be at least $1,950 per month?5] According to an IRS study, it takes a mean of 330 minutes for taxpayers to prepare, copy, and electronically file a 1040 tax form. This distribution of times follows the normal distribution and the standard deviation is 80 minutes. A consumer watchdog agency selects a random sample of 40 taxpayers.(a) What is the sampling distribution of the sample mean?(b) What is the probability that the sample mean is greater than 320 minutes?(c) What is the probability that the sample mean is between 320 and 350 minutes?(d) What is the probability that the sample mean is greater than 350 minutes?6] Majesty Video Production Inc. wants the mean length of its advertisements to be 30 seconds. Assume the distribution of ad length follows the normal distribution with a population standard deviation of 2 seconds. Suppose we select a sample of 16 ads produced by Majesty.(a) What is the sampling distribution of the sample mean time?(b) What percent of the sample means will be greater than 31.25 seconds?(c) What percent of the sample means will be greater than 28.25 seconds?(d) What percent of the sample means will be greater than 28.25 but less than 31.25 seconds?7] Traveling between two campuses of a university in a city via shuttle bus takes, on average, 28 minutes with a standard deviation of 5 minutes. In a given week, a bus transported passengers 40 times. What is the probability that the average transport time was more than 30 minutes? Assume the mean time is measured to the nearest minute.8] Two independent experiments are run in which two different types of paint are compared. Eighteen specimens are painted using type A, and the drying time, in hours, is recorded for each. The same is done with type B. The population standard deviations are both known to be 1.0. Assuming that the mean drying time is equal for the two types of paint, find , where  and  are average drying times for samples of size nA = nB = 18.9] A sample of 30 people is randomly selected from city A, where the average height of adults is 160 centimeters with a standard deviation of 9 centimeters. A second random sample of size 42 is selected form city B, where the average height of adults is 158 centimeters with a standard deviation of 10 centimeters. Find that probability that the sample mean computed from the samples selected from city A will exceed the sample mean computed from the samples selected from city B by at least 2.6 centimeters but less than 4.8 centimeters. Assume the difference of the means to be measured to the nearest tenth.10] The distribution of the weights of one-week-old chicks of a certain breed has a mean of 120 grams and a standard deviation of 12 grams. The distribution of weights of chicks of the same age of another breed is 92 grams with a standard deviation of 8 grams. Assuming that the sample mean can be calculated to any degree of accuracy, find the probability that the sample mean for the weights of 46 random chicks of first breed exceeds the sample mean for the weights of 84 random chicks of the second breed by at most 20 grams11]  Let   be the sample mean of a random sample of size 16 is selected from a normal population with mean of 30 and variance 4. Let   be the sample mean of a random sample of size 25 is selected from a normal population with mean of 28 and variance 7 independent of the first population. Evaluate:  (a) The sampling distribution of  .(b)                        (c)   </p>
