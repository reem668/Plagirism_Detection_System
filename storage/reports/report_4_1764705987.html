ProblemsHost A wants to send a 1Mbyte packet to Host B. The propagation speed of bits is Vp=2 *10^8 m/sec. Assume that A and B are connected via a router R. Link AR connects A to R, and link RB connects R to B. Link AR is d1=1Km long and link RB is d2=2Km long. Suppose that the capacity of each of the C= 2 links is 10 Mbytes/sec and the processing delay in the Router (R) is 10 msec. Find after how long host B will receive the packet. Note the Router (R) must receive the whole packet before being able to forward it. In modern packet-switched networks, the source host segments long, application-layer messages (for example, an image or a music file) into smaller packets and sends the packets into the network. The receiver then reassembles the packets back into the original message. We refer to this process as message segmentation. The figure below illustrates a switched network. Consider a message that is 7.5 * 10^6 bits long to be sent from the source to the destination. (Assume header size is negligible relative to the entire message size). Suppose each link is 1.5 Mbps. Focus on transmission delays only and assume all other delay components are negligible.Consider sending the message from source to the destination without message segmentation. How long does it take to move the message from the source host to the first packet switch? What is the total time to move the message from source to the destination host?Now suppose that the message is segmented into 5000 packets, with each packet being 1500 bits long. How long does it take to move the first packet from source to the first switch? When the first packet is being sent from the first switch to the second switch, the second packet is being sent from the source host to the first switch. At what time will the second packet be fully received at the first switch?How long does it take to move the file from source host to destination host when message segmentation is used?Compare this result with our answer in part (A) and give at least one advantage and disadvantage of message segmentation.Important Notice:
